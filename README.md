# Final-Year-Project
The algorithms for generation, visualisation, and AE-based classification of local compaction data are included as Jupyter notebooks.

1. Local compaction data generation (using window sizes in range 2-50)
2. Local compaction plot visualisation
3. a. Feature selection i - Random forest classifier training and analysis //
b. Feature selection ii - Multilayer perceptron classifier training and weight extraction + visualisation //
c. Feature selection iii - Estimation of Kolmogorov complexity using the gzip algorithm //
4. Autoencoder training and analysis - filtered data
5. Visualisation of data projection onto parametrised latent layer + clustering: using DBSCAN. Analysis of clusters obtained.

Also included are the local compaction plots for all window sizes (LCPs) and the Supplementary Figures SF1-SF3.
